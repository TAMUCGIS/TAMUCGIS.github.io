Howdy! 

We are testing out our development blog, besides working on this site (yay Markdown!) we are also working on a project
for the Art Dept. We will show some photos soon! 

A little technical background: this project is an experiment in a parallel embedded real time system.
We have a client server architecture, with the client code written in Erlang, and the server side code written in C. 
There will be a future post on the importance of rewriting code, to a newer language.

Stay tuned!
