We are a dedicated group of students at Texas A&M University - Commerce, whos purpose is to fulfill student led GIS and Data Science related projects.

A little history: 

The group was started in 2016 by a handful of students both graduate and undergraduate level, for the colleges of Computer Science, Engineering, and Business, in order to explore the cutting edge these fields. 

We realized early on that GIS / Data Science had the most potential to apply our knowledge in regards to what we have learned, and can provide the most good for the most amount of people. 

Stay tuned!
