Making maps with Javascript, or Cesium, Carto, and Leaflet (oh my!)
	
We will be updating the website, so that we can use Javascript, and the javascript libraries, to run specific maps of the data that our team uses. 
The point of this is so when we have an update of data that is related to the university, we can have a mass data pull, from our database to the client. 
The libraries that we will use are: Cesium, Carto and Leaflet. 
We will be updating our maps with multiple sources, so stay tuned!
