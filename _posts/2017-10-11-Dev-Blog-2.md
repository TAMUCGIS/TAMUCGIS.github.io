Making maps with Javascript, or Cesium, Carto, and Leaflet (oh my!)
	
Howdy! 

Since our group came back from FOSS4G in Boston this August (many thanks to the FOSS4G folks!) our team has been looking at better ways to update and increase our data analytics productivity. 

Currently we are looking into using Cesium, Carto, and Leaflet for the majority of the maps we want to use. 

There are a few advantages for this model: 

1. There a bindings (or will soon be) for other languages for use with these libraries. (We have currently looked at using R, and Python for Leaflet) 

2. VR and AR is possible with Javascript. Which is a huge bonus for us, as we get to work with Javascript and provide mobile apps that can be used for mobile and web devices.
